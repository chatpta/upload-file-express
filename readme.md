# Express-upload-file
 

Express-upload-file is a node.js middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, which is primarily used for uploading files. It is written
on top of [multer](https://github.com/expressjs/multer) for efficiency.

**NOTE**: Express-upload-file will not process data which is not (`multipart/form-data`).

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install express-upload-file
```
